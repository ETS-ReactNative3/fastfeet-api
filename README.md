ðŸšš Shipping company application that connects deliverymen and recipients - RESTful API made with Node.js
</p>

:rocket: The Challenge
------------------
This project is a challenge proposed during [**Rocketseat**](https://rocketseat.com.br/) GoStack bootcamp. The main objective is to create a backend application for an imaginary shipping company. Along with this server, I'll be developing the front-end side with React and the mobile application with React Native.

In this project the following technologies and libraries were used:

- [**Insomnia**](https://insomnia.rest/)

- [**ExpressJS**](https://expressjs.com/)
- [**Nodemon**](https://nodemon.io/)
- [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/)
