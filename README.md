Full control system for a shipping company - RESTful API made with Node.js
</p>

ðŸšš About FastFeet
------------------
This project is a full control system for a fictional shipping company called FastFeet. The full system has a [**web version**](https://github.com/riltonfranzonee/fastfeet), where the admin is able to take control of all processes, such as list/create/edit/delete/update deliveries, deliverymen, recipients and problems. The application also has a [**mobile version**](https://github.com/riltonfranzonee/fastfeet-mobile), where the deliveryman is able to list all his deliveries filtering by pending or delivered, register a problem during the process and also confirm the deliver by sending a picture of the recipient's signature.

:wrench: Technologies used:
----------------------
This RESTful API has a great level of complexity, combinig different types of databases, user authentication, email firing, file upload and a lot of CRUD's. To help me with all this work I used the following technologies: 

- [**Insomnia**](https://insomnia.rest/)
- [**NodeJS**](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [**ExpressJS**](https://expressjs.com/)
- [**Nodemon**](https://nodemon.io/)
- [**Docker**](https://www.docker.com/)
- [**PostgreSQL**](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [**Redis**](https://redis.io/)
- [**Sequelize**](https://sequelize.org/)
- [**Yup**](https://github.com/jquense/yup)
- [**jwt**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jsonwebtoken/)
- [**bcryptJS**](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcryptjs)
- [**multer**](https://github.com/expressjs/multer)
- [**date-fns**](https://date-fns.org/docs/Getting-Started)
